Decipher Front End Developer Coding Challenge

Greetings Starfleet cadet!  Write a program that uses data containing Star Trek: The Next Generation seasons.

General coding requirements:

1. Your program must be written in front-end web technologies and render in a browser.
2. ES6/ES7 transpilation via Babel or TypeScript and CSS pre/post processing using LESS/SASS/PostCSS is permitted as long as the build pipeline is well documented and allows assessors to execute the project via NPM scripts.
3. Please avoid the use of CoffeeScript, Reason, Dart or other compile-to-JS languages.
4. You may use any libraries or frameworks of your choosing but all dependencies should install cleanly via npm install.

Your program must do the following:

1. Make an HTTP call to http://ec2-52-90-200-167.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080 with error handling.
2. Render a list of episodes with (at least) the following data displayed: Title (Original Title), Season Number, and Episode Number.
3. Each list item should also show badges for Average Rating and Number of Votes.
4. Provide sorting by Title, Average Rating, and Number of Votes.
5. Add a control that allows changing seasons.

When you're done please zip up your app and send it back to us.
Please provide instructions, if any, for running your code.

Thanks! Live long and prosper!
